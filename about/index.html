	<p> 
	  My name is Emily Flippen, and I am <em><strong> NOT </strong></em> a personal financial advisor. In fact, 
 	  I'm not even a personal finanical planner, CPA, or any other three letter acronym that could somehow qualify me to create a 
	  blog based on personal finance. My very loose qualifications are that I somehow have an undergraduate degree in finance and a 
	  passion for personal financial planning. 
	    <br />
	  However, the more I studied the more I discovered that the entire financial industry seemed to be built on the premise of 
	  convincing people (especially women) that finance is too <em> hard</em> for them do tackle alone, thus you must pay someone
	  to handle it on your behalf.

        <br />
  <h1> 
	  This is not true!
  </h1>
  <p> 
	  I truly believe for the majority of people in the world, personal finances are able to be handled efficiently and effectively
    all on their own. You don't need to pay an expesive personal financial advisor or planner to help you with your financial
    goals! The hardest part is taking the first step, and I hope this blog will help inspire some people to begin to do that.
    <br />
    <br />
    Along the way I plan on sharing some of my own tricks to saving money (like cooking cheap, delicious, meals)
    in order to help people take control of their financial futures.
