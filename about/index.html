<div class="blurb">
  <p> My name is Emily Flippen, and I am <em><strong> NOT </strong></em> a personal financial advisor. In fact, 
    I'm not even a personal finanical planner, CPA, or any other three letter acronym that could somehow qualify me to create a 
    blog based on personal finance. My very loose qualifications are that I somehow have an undergraduate degree in Finance, 
    despite the fact I still can't do basic math or conversions in my head (a feat that I personally think is underrated). 
    <br />
    However, I have cultivated an intense passion for personal finance that has somehow extended itself into discovering new (old)
    ways to save money. I first discovered this when speaking with my friends and family, slowly becoming aware that basic personal
    finance was not something that was taught in school. In fact, the more I learned the more I discovered that the entire financial
    industry is dependent upon people believing that personal finance is too <em> hard</em> for them do tackle alone. </p>
    
    <br />
  <h1> This is not true! </h1>
  <p> I truly believe for the majority of people in the world, personal finances are able to be handled efficiently and effectively
    all on their own. You don't need to pay an expesive personal financial advisor or planner to help you with your financial
    goals! The hardest part is taking the first step, and I hope this blog will help inspire some people to begin to do that.
    <br />
    Along the way I plan on sharing some of my own tricks to saving money (like cooking cheap, delicious, meals)
    in order to help people take control of their financial futures.
